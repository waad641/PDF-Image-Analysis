# PDF-Image-Analysis
To read an image from a PDF file and analyze it to build graphics, you can use the PyPDF2 library to extract the image and then use the Pillow (PIL) library for image analysis and matplotlib for building graphics. First, make sure you have installed these libraries by running :"pip install PyPDF2 Pillow matplotlib" 
Replace "path/to/your/pdf/file.pdf" with the actual path to the PDF file you want to analyze. This code will extract all images from the PDF, and then you can add your image analysis code and plot the graphics using matplotlib.
